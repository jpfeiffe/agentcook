When your implementation is complete:

1. Verify your work compiles / passes basic checks.

2. Commit:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat({{AGENT_NAME}}): <description of what was built>"
```

3. Push and open a PR:
```bash
git push origin "$(git branch --show-current)"
gh pr create \
  --title "feat({{AGENT_NAME}}): <short description>" \
  --body "Closes #${ISSUE_NUMBER}

## Summary
- <what was built>

## Files
- <list>" \
  --base main
```

4. Comment on your issue with a completion summary:
```bash
gh issue comment "${ISSUE_NUMBER}" \
  --body ":white_check_mark: **Work complete**

**PR:** #<pr-number>
**What was built:**
- <bullet>

**Files created:**
- <list>"
```

Do not push to main directly. The orchestrator reviews and merges your PR.
